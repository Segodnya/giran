# Server

Node.js app to serve articles from a main branch of public Git repository.

TypeScript, Express, Marked.

Simple server app that uses our local Githuber service to provide API endpoints to get the list of content items and a specific item. The server processes markdown content into HTML before returning it to the client (we're using our own repository folder - https://github.com/Segodnya/giran/tree/main/content).

## API

## Features

- **Markdown Processing**: The server automatically converts markdown content to HTML using the `marked` library
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: Supports GFM features for better compatibility
- **Dual Format**: Returns both raw markdown (`content`) and processed HTML (`html`) for maximum flexibility

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed using Docker. The repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file that orchestrates the `server`, `githuber`, and `nginx` services.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running the application

1.  Navigate to the root of the `giran` repository.
2.  Run the following command to build and start the services in detached mode:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

3.  The application will be available at `http://localhost`.
    -   API requests to `/api/articles` will be routed to the `server` service.
    -   Other requests will be routed to the `githuber` service.

### Services

-   **server**: The main Node.js application that provides the API endpoints.
-   **githuber**: A service that the `server` app depends on to get data from GitHub.
-   **nginx**: A reverse proxy that routes requests to the appropriate service.
